## 📌 Project Title
**n8n Workflow Popularity System**

---

## 🧠 Brief One Line Summary
A fully automated backend system that **collects workflow data, calculates popularity scores, and publishes daily rankings of top n8n workflows via APIs**.

---

## 📖 Overview
The **n8n Workflow Popularity System** identifies trending and high-impact n8n workflows without manual tracking.

The system runs automatically every day at **12:00 AM**, fetches popularity signals, processes them using a scoring mechanism, stores results in a database, and exposes APIs to retrieve ranked workflows.

This project demonstrates **real-world backend automation, scheduling, data processing, and API development**.

---

## ❓ Problem Statement
There is no centralized and automated way to:
- Track popular n8n workflows consistently
- Rank workflows based on popularity metrics
- Access updated rankings programmatically

Manual tracking is inefficient, error-prone, and not scalable.

---

## 📊 Dataset
The dataset is **programmatically generated and refreshed daily**, consisting of:
- Workflow metadata (name, category)
- Popularity indicators (trend and activity signals)
- Date-wise popularity snapshots
